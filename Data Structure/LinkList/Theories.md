### Node 
Link list is made of many nodes. Eevery node contains same types of datas and the refrence to it's next node.

### Head Node
Each Linked List has a head or root node. Head node is the first node of any link list that contains it's data and the reference of the next node. It represents an entire link list. With out a head node we cannot access the link list or other node.

### Null Pointer
In order to end a link list we need a null pointer index. Null value is the stoping position that indicates the list has ended.
